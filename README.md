- 👋 Hi, I’m @APR-Echoss
- 👀 I’m interested in programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about roblox plugins and animating
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing
- Working on 3 games! 
- You can see my ROBLOX profile, Echoss (@AProgrammR)
- Also, my roblox group, Craft GD Studio!
- I use this GitHub account for Roblox Plugins
- I first learned about Lua before any other programming language. (I learned Python and Java)
- Currently, I am making a ROBLOX plugin and a ROBLOX game named 'Discover it's land' which is a adventure and survival game!
